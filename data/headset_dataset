These headphones will absolutely do if you're not ready to drop $100+ bucks on a set of uber headphones.<br />I used them gaming with my PC using the included TRRS to TRS (headphone and Mic Y-cable) and got very pleasing results. Crisp highs and deep lows. Also, compared to other headphones, the sound felt like it was a little 'closer' to my ears and felt more immersive than some other sets I've tried at this price level.<br />*Added Bonus* i didn't know about (I missed it somehow) was the included 7.1 simulated surround sound software. I know what you're thinking because you've used these before.

57312,2,Edit: Failed in less than a year.,"Edit: I intend to keep my original review attached to this update, for the sake of showing the full spectrum of my feelings on these headphones. However, I must confess that these headphones have broken. The failure of the headphones wasn't in their sound, it was in their construction. The right earcup started to feel loose, like it wasn't pushed against my head at all. I took them off to inspect them, and discovered that the point where the cup attaches to the extender part of the headphones was very weak, as if I had bent them intentionally. Shortly thereafter, it completely fell off in my hands. I suspect that this happened because I have fallen asleep on my right side wearing these headphones before, however, it has only happened a couple of times, and never for more than 20 minutes or so. I would like to think that a pair of headphones could withstand that. I've never had that happen to any other headset I've owned, even if I had fallen asleep with them for the entire night. I reduced my rating to 2 stars, because even if they broke, some of the blame definitely lies on me. Besides that, if you never do anything like what I did, they will probably serve you very well. They are still super comfortable and still sound fantastic for the price, so don't let my one negative experience completely detract from the positive aspects of this headset.<br />Here is my original review, from before they broke.<br /><br />I bought these to replace the original Razer Krakens I bought back in around 2015 or so. They still worked great after several years, but the faux leather was in absolute ruin and was leaving green chunks in my hair whenever I put them on, so I figured it was time to buy a new pair.<br /><br />They didn't sell the originals anymore, of course, so I went with the current headphones that were being sold in the same price bracket: around $50 to $60. I came across these, and was a little concerned at first that the quality would be lower than the ones I had been using prior, but I decided to give it a chance anyway.<br /><br />So let's get into the specifics.<br /><br />Sound Quality:<br /> I'll be frank: these don't sound quite as good as the original Krakens. I've been using these for several months now, and I can safely say that they're broken in and all, so I must be honest and start with that. Now, if you've never used the original Krakens, this won't mean much to you. These headphones do sound fantastic, I can't lie about that. I'm no audiophile, so I can't give a very detailed description, but suffice it to say that they have a good range of dynamics, they are loud, crisp and clear, and they have solid bass. Once again, they are fantastic, but compared to the original Krakens, I must say that they do sound slightly more... hollow, for lack of a better term. There is likely some software to fiddle and finetune the settings to your liking, but I specifically wanted to talk about the out-of-the-box experience, for the sake of the ""average user"".<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend these on sound quality alone.<br /><br />Comfort:<br />I've never been too bothered by headphones that people typically say are uncomfortable, so take what I say with a grain of salt. (For point of reference, the only headphones I've ever used that I can't use due to discomfort are Apple Ear/AirPods.) These are average in comfort, in my opinion. They certainly aren't uncomfortable. They're very light, it's not as though there's a highly noticeable weight added to your head when you put them on or anything like that. They don't press too hard, they're highly adjustable, they stay in place very well (at least when you adjust their size to your head properly) and there's nothing here I can complain about.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend these for comfort factor.<br /><br />Build Quality:<br />As I said before, these are light. To some, that's a sign of quality. To others, it's a sign of cheapness. When I first held them, compared to the original Krakens, they felt cheap to me simply because they were significantly lighter. But after using them for several months, with my biases long gone, I must say that they really do feel quite great, similar quality to the original Krakens at least. The faux leather feels nice and durable, the headband feels flexible yet sturdy, and the swivel on the cups doesn't rattle or seem unintentional in any way. They look nice, they feel nice, and I'm inclined to believe that they are, indeed, a nice pair of headphones.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend these on the quality of the materials, manufacturing, etc.<br /><br />Mic Quality:<br />It's a little hard to judge this, given that I'm not the one hearing my voice. When I asked my friends how I sound, they said I sounded fine. Good, clear (when my internet would allow it, at least) and not static-y or garbled or anything like that. I will mention, however, that you must make sure the mic is reasonably close to your mouth when you speak, even with sensitivity all the way up, because if it drifts a little away from my mouth, my friends immediately take notice and complain about it.<br /><br />Overall, good mic quality, but beware of distance from your mouth.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />This is a nice pair of headphones. They're not wireless, they're not Astros, they're not the top of the line by any means. But that doesn't mean that these won't work for you. For a pair of headphones that will last, that sound fantastic, and will allow you to comfortably game for many hours on end, this is a good place to start. If you want to start cheap, I'd ask you to rethink that decision. Sure, you could spend $25 for a pair of headphones that check most of the same boxes, but they probably won't be as good, nor will they be a reputable brand, and for that matter, they're far less likely to last very long. These will last for many years (as long as you don't abuse them) and are well worth the money in my opinion.<br /><br />TL;DR:<br />These are good headphones, and you should definitely buy them if you're looking for a set that'll last you a long time.",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AHYTW6VIRSEITNDA5FQPG3TQGMEQ,2020-07-15 02:17:43.003,23,True

75840,3,Exceptional For the Price,"***Edit (4/21/20)*** apparently them being so lightweight was too good to be true. The adjustable size plastic part on the left ear snapped when I went to put them on today. Logged 8 months of playtime, so that’s probably around 400 or so hours. Lowered one star because that’s not durable enough, imo.<br /><br />I have been using the same Razer Carcharias headset for nearly a decade, not knowing how outdated it was, sound quality-wise. While the Carcharias were extremely comfortable and had a long, strong wire, there have been great strides in the gaming headset world.<br /><br />So, enter this most recent Kraken (X Ultralight) headset, also from Razer, which is about a third of what I paid for my old headset, with double the sound quality.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Sound quality - Like I said, it is excellent. Playing BO4 and Blackout, I hear everything better. With the emergence of the BR genre, it's very important to have a headset that tells you exactly where shots are coming from. These do that job very well.<br /><br />Mic quality - This one is huge. I asked my brothers (who I play with, usually in a party, how these stacked up against my old headset and they said it was much better. They said these were a 9 and my old ones were a 6 or a 7. They couldn't hear cars going by outside, even with my window open, and it didn't pick up the hum of my air conditioner, which was a problem with my old headset's mic. Also, I love that it's bendable, which my old headset's mic wasn't.<br /><br />Comfort - The best thing to do, when testing the comfort of a gaming headset, is to just play for about 4 hours straight, which is exactly what I did. They aren't QUITE as comfortable as my old headset, but they are comfy and never bothered me, which too many headsets do.<br /><br />The mute button/volume - They're in the perfect spot. You can adjust them relatively easily while playing, rather than fumbling around with the cord searching for the little plastic piece with the controls on it. The mute button is spring-loaded, while the volume is a wheel. Simple and effective.<br /><br />The Look - These things are simple and sleak. I love how they look.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Material quality - This could be completely unfounded, but I often look at the ""lightweight"" feature that products boast as an excuse for them to use cheap plastic materials. It feels like it could easily break. If it doesn't after a while, I'll be forced to edit this. The cord, too, feels cheap, especially compared to the cord on my Carcharias, which was - to put it bluntly - badass.<br /><br />The mic: While I love that it's bendable and sounds great, it's annoying that you can't fold it up like with other Razer headsets. Not that I'm ever going to use these, listening to music in public. They're only for gaming. But it's easier to store a headset when there's not a big mic jutting out of it.<br /><br />OVERALL VERDICT:<br /><br />This is an exceptional headset for the price, that I'd absolutely recommend. 4.5/5",[],B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AGVX7DCPTRBE272ISRQR56QTPYYA,2019-08-29 01:43:23.255,0,False

236609,4,Decent,"This is probably my first actual Razer product I bought for myself, I tend to avoid Razer because they're usually overpriced and the quality is subpar so I wanted to take a gambol with this. Right out of the box, I did notice how light weight they are. Probably the most light weight headset I have ever owned thus far.  I like how the volume and mute button are behind the ear pieces so you can't easily touch them. I also don't like those settings on a wire like a lot of headphones are. My only beef with these are the mic quality and some of the sound quality. They sound decent, but not enough bass to me. The surround sound software you have to download, you don't really need it but it can help in some situations. The mic is quiet. Very quiet if you want to talk on it and it easily picks up sound from the headset if your volume is loud. If you're using Discord you can kinda fix that, but anything else your sound might get picked up.

248332,3,Hardly any bass,"Considering the price, this is a decent headset - working mic that sounds good, noise-blocking ear cushions help make a good experience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the audio quality is not great, which is less than I expected from a brand with this reputation. Essentially, there is no good bass reproduction - listening to music (especially EDM or hip hop) will leave you feeling regret over this purchase. I know these aren't Sennheiser headphones and you probably didn't buy them for music, but I personally hoped to have a multipurpose headset, and this does not satisfy. Also, if you like strong bass in your video games, this headset will not satisfy.<br /><br />If this weren't a Razer headset I would maybe forgive the worse audio but I expected more from a brand like Razer.  For $50 it does what I need it to do, but if you like quality sound, spend more or choose a different brand.<br /><br />Also - the ""7.1 surround"" app that comes with this, is a complete gimmick.

344391,4,"Good, but not as good as the Kraken","This is the little brother of the Kraken, which is by far my favorite wired gaming headset of all time.  While it is easily on par with other headsets in this same price range, there were just too many cost saving measures taken to allow it to survive a comparison with its older brother with all of its stars intact.  The first thing that struck me was how much more pressure the band seems to apply.  It could be that the band is tighter than in the Kraken proper, or that the decreased surface area of the smaller cups doesn’t do as much to distribute the load, but either way it is not as comfortable.  It’s noticeably lighter than its older brother, though that doesn’t count for much if it isn’t corresponding more comfortable, which it isn’t.  The performance of the mic seems about the same to me.  The cord is a definite downgrade as well - rather than a nylon braided sheath, it's a soft grooved plastic. The smaller drivers make a noticeable impact on the sound, but I wouldn’t go so far as to say this is a decisive difference.<br /><br />The headset claims to magically support 7.1 surround through its stereo phono connection via the use of some software program that only runs on Windows and requires a code to download.  There’s a scratch card with the code included with the headset, but as I am primarily a Linux user I haven’t been curious enough to try it out.  If the mood strikes me, and it’s worth writing about I’ll update this review.<br /><br />It may seem like I’m down on the Kraken X, but I really do think it’s a nice headset.

344924,5,Ultra-Light and a Great Value,"The Kraken X is Razer's value model of their beefier Kraken headset. At 40mm, the drivers are not as substantial as on its big brother, but the headset is also noticeably lighter.<br /><br />The lighter weightmeans the headset is extremely comfortable for marathon gaming sessions. This is an extraordinarily comfortable headset, thanks both to the all-plastic construction and the strategic placement of memory foam. It's easy to forget it's on your head.<br /><br />The sound quality is also surprisingly good for 40mm cans. The mids are distinct, and the highs are clear, albeit a bit tinny on the high end.

The sound quality isn't as rich, deep, or clear as with larger drivers and more expensive headsets.

572093,4,Quality product from Razer.,"I have been using these headphones for a month now. I usually use them with my VR headset. The volume is very loud and very clear, and when I way loud, these go louder than any headset I have ever owned. I’m usually using them at about half volume. Which brings me to one of the cons I feel this headset has, the volume rocker is very small and finding it, especially wearing the VR headset is very tedious.<br /><br />The mic is very clear and no one that I have played with has told me any different. The headset itself is very comfortable and can wear them for hours at a time.<br /><br />Now these say that they have 7.1 capability through the Razer surround download on PC. For the life of me I can not get this to work with my laptop, which is a gaming laptop and itself has surround technology. Now this doesn’t mean it doesn’t work, just means I couldn’t get it to work and I have been building and working on computers since I was a wee lad. Though I am pretty. Sure that it’s my laptop that is the problem, I don’t know how you would get 7.1 out of stereo headphones considering that the 7 means 7 different channels and 1 bass channel.<br /><br />Overall these are great headphones for gaming and I would recommend these to anyone looking for some good headphones.",[],B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AGSDOV2VULWGSSM2KJLHOMDO66YQ,2019-08-23 01:33:28.992,0,False

936435,5,"Truly lightweight, clear sound, clear mic","Full discretion, I've only had this one day. If something changes, I'll come back and edit this review.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It is truly as lightweight as they claim. It feels almost like you're not wearing a headset at all. I have a small-to-average size head for a guy and I use the smallest headband adjustment. It doesn't feel like it's tight on my head.<br /><br />The sound -- especially with Windows Sonic turned on -- is not bad at all. It's not as immersive as a pair of wireless Wyze headphones that I have, but it's pretty close. The directional sound in these things are pretty great too. Sometimes it really does sound like someone is walking/talking behind me when I'm in apps that allow directional sound.<br /><br />The microphone is pretty neat. It's very responsive. Everyone I asked in meetings today said that I sounded very clear. It doesn't cancel noise very well at all, though. I sit about 3-4' away from a computer enclosure that has 2 pretty loud fans. I turned the ""listen"" mode on in the Windows Sound Control Panel, and I could hear the fans whirring pretty good. It got quite a bit better, though, when I turned the sensitivity down in the control panel. So, with some tweaking, maybe it would cancel sound just fine.<br /><br />One other thing I like is that the sound controls are build into the earcup instead of inline with the cable. The headset that I returned to get this one had the controls inline, and I was constantly getting it hung on my chair, pressing it with my chest into my desk, catching it on this-or-that. It was very annoying, so I'm glad this one has just a straight cable.<br /><br />It's a small thing, but I also like that the cable connected with a 90-degree connector instead of a straight plug. I can see how this would lead to the longevity of the headset because it's a lot harder to refract the cable beyond its limits if it is already at a 90.<br /><br />One last positive thing: the box was is pristine condition. It was shipped as though they cared about the product: tons of air cushions, there was a dehumidifying packet in with the headset, it was in plastic, inside a cardboard spacer, inside a box, inside tissue paper. Someone really spent some effort trying to make sure this thing was everything it is supposed to be.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The cord could be longer. It feels like it might be 5, 6 feet maximum. It's enough for me, but just barely. When I stand up at my desk, I can just barely turn my head.<br /><br />- I've only enabled this with Windows Sonic turned on (the Windows version of Dolby Atmos), my machine gets very laggy. It's an i7 with 16 GB of RAM, so it's not a wimpy laptop by any stretch. The CPU gets interrupted at a very high clip.",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AFDNASBG4STLHOOCX4GYYC4OVYHQ,2021-05-29 02:37:06.618,0,True

1035145,4,Surprising Value - An Unfair Review,"I purchased this headset for around $40, which is close to if not the least I have paid for a pair of headphones in the last three years. For that price, these are very good headphones.<br /><br />For this review I will be comparing them to Bose QC35 from several years ago. Those cost me $200 for comparison.<br /><br />Sound Quality<br />The Bose puts a little emphasis on bass, but its bass does not go as low as some of the best headphones I have.<br />The Razer Kraken does not boost the low frequencies, but it does a wide clear sound stage.<br /><br />Mic Quality<br />The Bose has a mic on its cord that dangles close to your chest.<br /><br />The Kraken has a supposedly cardiod mic at your mouth. When this mic is positioned correctly, it does pick up the subtler qualities of your voice. (It does not make you sound like a radio host, if you don't have a voice for that unfortunately.)<br /><br />Because the mic is so close to my lips, about a 1/4 inch sometimes, I can talk softly.<br /><br />The mic is supposed to not pick up background noise, but this does not work as well as I hoped it would. If I type on my keyboard, which is positioned on the opposite side of the mic, I can hear the clicks in the recording playbacks. Worse, I had someone's conversation directly behind me be picked up by my mic.<br /><br />Comfort<br />Compared to the Bose, the Kraken X has deep ear cups with foam. At first, it feels hard against your head, but after a while the foam adjusts to your head's shape and it doesn't feel as hard.<br />I have worn it for hours without pressure on my ears or head, but my ears did get warm eventually -- not uncomfortably warm, but warm.<br /><br />Build<br />The headphones are quite sturdy and heavy. They have fallen off my work table twice onto the hardwood floor. It didn't seem to suffer any damage from that. I do not plan to conduct further drop tests.<br /><br />I have noticed that the boom where it attaches to the ear cups have a bit of wiggle. I don't know whether this was present when I received it, a result of daily use or a consequence of me dropping it.<br /><br />Noise Cancellation<br />The foam padding isolates noise well enough.

I highly recommend anyone who is in the market for a headset with a decent-quality boom mic to give this a consideration.<br /><br />Other Thoughts<br />Unlike the newer Bluetooth earpods and headphones from Bose and Apple and Sony that have mic arrays and beam forming mics, the approach on this pair of headphones uses an older -- but not out-dated -- technique.

1097112,1,"Garbage, broke in less than 2 months, Razer refused to honor 2 year warranty! AVOID!!!!!","My 13 year old saved his money to get this, and was happy when he got it. Sound quality was mediocre, but it was good enough for his Fortnite and his distance learning school needs. In less than 2 months, the head strap broke and completely separated. This was not misuse or abuse, and he doesn't have a big head (well, figuratively he may, but that's a different story.) This thing just straight up broke in less than 2 months.<br /><br />Being outside the normal Amazon return window, we contacted Razer directly because headsets have a 2 year warranty. After sending pictures, they denied our warranty claim because a ""senior technician"" said it was ""excluded"" and they couldn't provide a replacement, so we're out $50. Their website clearly says headsets have a 2 year warranty and the exclusions page only excludes cosmetic damage or minor damage, or damage arising from misuse. None of this is applicable. Fortunately, Amazon took care of this.<br /><br />So, this headset is garbage, and the company is completely UNETHICAL. DO NOT BUY RAZER products, unless you're OK with throwing your money away if something goes wrong.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/12/20: After letting Razer know I would report them to Amazon and demanded to know exactly what ""exclusion"" allowed them to not honor their warranty (using verbage almost identical to other people who have had the same issues), they miraculously ""approved"" my return and tried to forward an RMA shipping label. I replied several times that Amazon had refunded me and I didn't want or need their help anymore, yet they persist. Now I have to actually ignore them since they won't acknowledge my emails anymore.<br /><br />Also, I usually avoid negative reviews and try to find positive, and I tend to give companies the benefit of doubt. When this headset broke, I tried doing everything I could to get a positive resolution, and exchanged multiple emails with Razer customer service explaining the issue and sending a high resolution picture. They were clear that they would NOT honor their 2 year warranty. I searched for similar issues and found a ton of information on reddit, and many disgruntled customers shared information, and the Razer denial of warranty language is very consistent, which leads me to believe they have a boilerplate warranty denial email they send out as a matter of practice. This is my opinion, but they have quite a track record of not standing behind their products. There are enough brands out there that there is no reason to give this company your money.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PaA9EdxgL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PaA9EdxgL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61PaA9EdxgL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AEMTYL7O7GYLLE5NY7GZKPNDFVMA,2020-10-08 02:36:52.580,0,False

1114053,4,"Great for the money, but light on bass","I bought this primarily for playing Monster Hunter on the PS4, and secondarily as a videoconferencing headset for work on a MacBook Pro. I'll admit the shade of blue used in the product photos was arresting to me, and the actual colors in person are faithful to the photos.<br /><br />Overall, the sound quality is good for a headset of this price. Not audiophile quality by any means, but perfect for videoconferencing or casual gaming. I haven't tried a first person shooter with surround capability, so I can't speak to how well the headset does on that front.<br /><br />As noted in the title, bass is very thin, which is okay for videoconferencing, but not in most action-oriented games, where bass can be used for impact. Because of that, I may look for another headset for playing action games, and keep this for videoconferencing.<br /><br />In Microsoft Teams on a MacBook Pro, Teams would sometimes not pick up any sound from the Kraken X's microphone, despite recognizing it as a usable device. Restarting Teams and plugging in the headset again seemed to remedy the issue.<br /><br />The controls on the device, a volume wheel and microphone mute button, are positioned so your left thumb would fall on them when you reach up to your left ear. The volume control works fine, and it's probably just my own memory problem to remember that the microphone button in the UP position is muted, while in the DOWN (flush with the body of the headset) position, the microphone was on. The mic button shows red when muted, but you can't see it when it's on your head, and the red sometimes confused me since red is also associated with recording. (Again, probably just me overthinking it.)<br /><br />The mic itself is on an easily positionable arm, and picks up my voice very clearly for people on the other end to hear--and just me, not noises in the room around me.<br /><br />Weight-wise, this is the lightest headset I've owned with the features it possesses. This headset is significantly lighter than the older Razer Electra V1 headset, which means it is more comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. And for those who wear glasses, like me, there was no negative effect of my glasses being squeezed or pressed into the sides of my head at all.<br /><br />A downside of such a cheap headset is that the mic and headphone cable are not detachable, which means they can't be replaced.<br /><br />In short, a good overall headset I'd recommend to non-gamers, or gamers who don't play action-oriented games that rely on bass for effect.",[],B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AEE5JZLC74UB57ZDSQWEKN7XNDPA,2022-04-08 16:09:24.278,0,True

1287364,1,Haven't even owned for 5 months and plastic part broke and having connectivity issues. UPDATE,"So within the past month, I've had a lot of connectivity issues with my headset. Sometimes when my arm brushes up against the cable, the sound will start cutting in and out, and I'll have to mess with the headphone jack (like turning it a certain way while its inside the aux port for it to start working again). Its starting to get really annoying. I ended up buying a different splitter, and that worked for a while, but then I started having the same problems again. Also the plastic part that attached to the speakers where you can adjust it, just broke! I'm always very careful when putting them on or taking them off, so I was surprised to see that it had snapped (not all the way through. I can still put them on, but I'll show a pic so you can all see what I mean) Before I bought this head set, I had a cheap pair that I paid $20 for, and they never once had any connectivity issues, and the plastic parts never broke. They were actually really durable. Whats sad to me is that a $20 headset was way more durable than these Krakens. Since its too late to return or exchange, I'm hoping the warranty can cover whats wrong with my headset. I understand that this is a budget headset for $50, but If a $20 headset is more durable than these Krakens, then why did I even bother buying these?<br /><br />So I got a 2nd headset from a warranty. At first they didn't want to give me a new headset because they determined that I was the one that broke the headset even though I would carefully put them on and take them off, but the sound was also cutting in and out of the headset, so I was able to get a replacement. So anyways...THE EXACT SAME THING HAPPENED. After a few months use, the plastic headband snapped. I was even more careful, because I acknowledged that I could have probably not been careful enough the first time, but no matter how careful I was the cheap plastic they use to make these snapped. I'm never buying Razer headset again. They are made out of cheap ass plastic. Its sad that a $20 headset is more durable than these pieces of crap.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BWxVEFPPL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BWxVEFPPL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81BWxVEFPPL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81utk8rSFsL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81utk8rSFsL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81utk8rSFsL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AE4K2BEJVBWJLBWZWF2ZSFTRJK4A,2021-04-29 00:36:02.823,2,True

Retractable Mic & volume setting features are on the cord as opposed to the headset cup. I went through 2-3 of these over the course of like...8 years or so?

1389476,1,DO NOT BUY,"[[VIDEOID:5ee863d041af3ed408a0687f90ac6248]] (Video is the sound produced solely from the microphone while using the mute button, clicking on and off at 03 seconds, and again, on and off at 06 seconds. This pop is the same on both Mac and Windows OS.)<br /><br />This isn't a joke, take the warnings seriously from previous reviews. I saw the star ratio and thought it couldn't be that bad, despite some of the warnings. DO NOT BUY.<br /><br />Razer is a well-known brand in the gaming industry, so I expected it to beat my previous $20 headset from a little unknown brand that died after 5 years of gaming. This headset failed in EVERY category.<br /><br />  Ease of use:<br />I have both Mac and Windows 10 OS on the same computer; Mac was flawlessly able to use the combo audio jack with no setup; Windows 10 took 5 hours, a USB adapter and a lot of tears to setup, resulting in it STILL being unreliable after a month of trying. I give up.<br /><br />In order to use this Razer headset, apparently you MUST install the 7.1 Surround Sound driver. I tried to use this headset with my existing drivers, and in NO way would it work unless I completely DELETED my previous audio driver. This then left me with NO sound being produced from my Windows 10 computer, AT ALL. Eventually, I did manage to get sound but now it exclusively will only play sound through the headset, and this is regardless of any sound priority given by assigning ""default"" devices.<br /><br />Then, Razer instructs you to download software in order to ""complete setup"" of the 7.1 surround sound. I tried this several times, but you MUST create an account, of which you need to wait for an email to confirm the account creation. It has been nearly 2 months and I have not received a single email, despite using two different emails, and checking spam.<br /><br />So now, my ENTIRE sound system is being held hostage because I can't get a single email from them. In order to fix this, I have to re-install Windows 10, because my computer will no longer discover the correct audio driver to replace this Razer ""7.1 surround sound"" driver.<br /><br />For this SOLE reason, DO NOT BUY this headset. My computer is now in a worse condition after just trying a HEADSET of all things!<br /><br />  Audio quality:<br />There has been no improvement to my sound quality at all. Not only could I not test out the 7.1 Surround Sound (due to their lack of sending and email to complete the setup), I was also unable to notice ANY difference between this headset and any other cheap headsets/microphone I've owned.<br />The audio from the microphone itself is actually lacking volume if anything. I've had many people in-game tell me the microphone's base level was far too quiet compared to other microphones.<br /><br />  Controls/buttons:<br />The volume slider on the side IS nice and simple to use.<br /><br />However, the microphone ""mute"" button is atrocious to use. I specifically purchased this headset for the simple mute button. I have a short video showing the volume peak, with the sound ONLY from the microphone playing. Listen for yourself.<br /><br />Aside from the sound driver issue, this is the worst feature about this headset. Reviews have mentioned a popping, but I never expected the microphone to fully peak in volume due to the mute button. It announces very loudly that you're muting, and isn't discrete at all. I use Discord frequently and no amount of sound cancelling can prevent this massive peak from being heard, as it is MUCH louder than your voice will ever be!<br /><br />  Conclusion:<br />How on Earth could a headset cause such a headache?! Overall, this is unusable, the features are DETRIMENTS, and I have to go fix my computer now.

Firstly, if you're reading this: either spend the extra money for a more expensive set or find something else.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />Incredibly Lightweight - Probably the lightest headphones I've ever used apart from cheap $10 pairs<br /><br />Comfortable - Lack of weight makes them very comfortable to wear, even for long periods<br /><br />The Cons:<br />Sound Quality - Quality is worse than other cheaper headsets; for me at least, the sound was imbalanced, playing louder in the right ear than the left<br /><br />Connectivity Issues - Having been through multiple headsets, these are the first pair that refuse to allow me to use both the mic and the headphones at the same time. I spent a longer time trying to resolve this issue than should be necessary<br /><br />Mic Quality - When the mic was connected, the quality was poor at best.

1452277,5,Best In Class Comfortable But Sound Quality Below Average,"I have somewhat of a mixed track record with Razer products.  I think there is general agreement that the aesthetic designs are some of the leading in the industry, but products can be a hit or miss on quality and technical grounds.  For gaming, the audio is satisfactory with good directional placement and clear voice transmissions.  For music, I think that Razer still has much room to improve on the quality of the sound transmission as the treble is a bit unstable and the bass is underwhelming compared with other models even within Razer.<br /><br />I do think these should be especially considered if ergonomics is a priority in your buy.  These are outstanding in terms of the wear.<br /><br />The main draw for these headphones is the physical design.  While these are beautiful, Razer made some great strides in the ergonomics.  The placement and feel on my head is better than even higher-end gaming headphones and is the clear leader within the comparison products from other manufacturers.

It’s also priced extremely well. It has 7.1 surround sound. This sound configuration is pretty common in home theatres. You also get the bass which is always a plus. As for the microphone, it has a cardioid pickup pattern which means that it picks up the most sound from the front and keeps most of the background sound out. I’m interested in seeing if the sound quality changes when I bend the microphone. I haven’t had time to play around with that too much. I’m assuming they figured out a way to position the speaker so that the sound is just as clear when you bend the microphone, but we’ll see. Anyways, this is a great choice for a headset. I’m giving it four stars because of some of the unknowns.

There's also a volume dial and mute button on the left side of the headset. The mic is also located on the left side and unlike the Kraken V2, is unretractable. The mic is Crystal clear upon testing which is surprising considering the price.

So this is the reason why the 7.1 surround feature is not activated on your headset.""<br /><br />This is clearly, 100% erroneous, considering the packaging, instruction manual, and inclusion of an activation code to begin with all state 7.1 Surround Sound is part of this headset. That was the whole reason for me buying it to begin with. I included a picture of the package and headset as proof that yes, it does state 7.1 Surround Sound is part of it. This is how horrible their customer support is.<br /><br />In hindsight, I wish I had just returned this headset when I saw the activation code was used.

Works great on the Xbox with the jack right into the controller. Functionality wise it's a nice headset for the price, plastic construction keeps it cheap, sounds quality is nothing crazy but it's good for what it is. Surround 7.1 never really worked for me, but oh well - it's just software that has nothing to do with the headset anyway.<br /><br />Mute button and volume control on the head set work well on the Xbox, the incredibly frustrating problem (and the reason for the 3 star review) is when I use the splitter that is required to use it with my PC, no matter what I do there is speaker feedback into the microphone. This means when I listen to music or game sounds while playing they get passed back into the microphone and everyone in chat can hear what's coming out of my headphones (even if the mute key is pressed!) This isn't caused by audible feedback, I can adjust the volume at the headphone output to basically turn off the headset volume, without the microphone input that shows up at the input device changing.  This is frustrating because a big reason I bought the headset was analog mute button.<br /><br />I'll try contacting the seller and see if this is a manufacturing defect and update accordingly.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xgFXk7D2L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xgFXk7D2L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81xgFXk7D2L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AEEFJPIHFV67ZBGL4AKBWU3HO2FA,2020-08-18 00:07:44.651,1,True
1913028,4,"It does what it needs to do well, but the build quality is suspect","From a usability standpoint, they're fine.  The audio quality is good - the microphone is good enough, but it's a bit weak on the sound pick-up (I need to keep the mic closer to my mouth than I'm used to from other headsets).  They are light-weight.<br /><br />I have a problem with the microphone mute button location at the back of the left earphone - it's exactly where I have to grab it so it's very easy to inadvertently push it.  I need to be careful not to mute myself while getting into unexpected calls/meetings.  The padding on the headband is covered by a very poorly attached plastic covering - it came out only after a few weeks of use, while mostly hanging on a wide headphone hook.  So far the ear covers/padding are holding up fine - and the generally pretty comfortable - I expect this will be the next failure point for aesthetics though.<br /><br />They are fine for what they are - but I don't think they're worth $25+...I expect them to have other build-quality issues over the next year or so and require either hacked/DIY fixes or replacement.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JUMUQid8L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JUMUQid8L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51JUMUQid8L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AEULFH7V4TRLYDUUEKHAUTC5YAKA,2023-02-06 21:17:59.722,4,True

1919227,5,Don’t listen to negative reviews,"I bought a Series S last week and needed a new headset to go along with it. I was very skeptical because of the negative reviews on here, but I was intrigued by the low price. Don’t listen to the negative reviews, they are very misleading in my experience. The sound is really good, I’m not an audiophile but I do have a couple fairly expensive headsets (one for my PS4 and one for general use). These were a very pleasant surprise, I have zero complaints about the sound quality. For the price, you won’t find anything better. They do feel very cheap, the lightweight design is nice for comfort, but it just feels like a cheaply made product. The cord is a decent length and I like how it comes with a splitter so you can use it with a PC. Doesn’t come with a carrying bag like other headsets unfortunately. The stupid surround sound activation is exactly that: stupid. Why do I have to use a code to activate a feature on a headset? Literally no one else does that. I’m not even 100% sure you can use the surround sound on consoles because you need the app to activate it. The noise canceling is solid, I snapped my fingers by each side of my head and could barely make out the sound. The mic is pretty good too, according to friends I’ve asked about it.

2122089,5,The best budget headset – Period,"Razer nailed it with this budget headset offering. For the price, you’re getting a good sounding and stylish headset that comes with software feature support not to mention boasting the best mic in this price range – bar none.<br /><br />- Sound<br />If you’ve ever owned a Razer headset in the past you are likely aware of their bass-heavy sound signature. It’s polarizing, to say the least, as some love Razer’s sound; others hate it. I am in the former category but this year, at least in this headset, Razer opted to tone down the bass a bit allowing space for subtle notes found in the midranges and highs to shine through. A quick search online for reviews of Razer headsets will invariably lead to some review where someone is complaining about muddy mids and highs, but I didn’t find that to be the case with this headset. While mids and highs are not exactly crisp, they’re clearly represented which is something I couldn’t always say with Razer headsets. In addition to tweaking the signature sound that is delivered by default on this headset, Razer includes a 7.1 surround sound software enhancement that actually works. Whether it’s listening to games, movies or music the software allows users to further build on the refinements they made to the sound signature allowing listeners to enjoy a special separation and a customizable sound stage.<br /><br />- Aesthetics<br />The matte black, totally blacked out design language of this headset is something I appreciate. Even the Razer logo is blacked out and there are no RGB elements. While some may be disappointed in this choice, I am delighted by it. I don’t need anything that may clash with my color scheme. If I am rocking a red and black gaming theme, I don’t want that broken up by Razer’s green logo. I very much appreciate that it is black this time around. I also like the choice of Black and Glossy Lettering along the top band of the headset. This fits well with a headset that seems to have been designed with a level of sophistication meant for us gamers who are no longer teenagers.<br /><br />- Fit and Feel<br />I am bald (shaved, I feel that’s an important distinction to make lol) the top band of this headset fits directly on the crown of my head. The padding is soft and thick enough to make a 2 to 4-hour gaming session comfortable, but any longer would be quite a stretch. Razer designed the earcups with a channel for those who wear glasses (or shades if you’re that guy/girl) while they game. The clamping force is tight but not uncomfortably so; this allows for a good seal that creates just enough isolation for the speakers to deliver sound without competing with ambient background noise.<br /><br />- What’s the catch?<br />With any ‘budget’ offering companies straddle the line between costs and feature sets. To get this headset down to budget pricing Razer implemented a couple of noticeable compromises. The first is in the materials used. There is synthetic leather along the earcups. This was a good decision for sound as a cloth alternative such as one used in Corsair’s budget headset offering does generate less heat over time, however, sealing and isolation compromised which contributes to poorer sound. Razer decided to make a concession to comfort in favor of delivering superior sound and I appreciate their decision.<br /><br />Another compromise that was made was to the mic and 3.5mm headset connectors. While the cardioid does a really good job of capturing sound and attempting to eliminate background noise, Razer once again opted for the superior sound experience over build quality. In the case of the mic, it’s permanently attached which means there’s no flip to mute. Related, this design choice means this headset is best used at home as transporting a headset with a permanently attached mic is impractical and looks out of place.<br /><br />The implementation of the 3.5mm follows suit with the mic as it too is permanently affixed. This is a mixed bag as this headset is compatible with consoles, tablets, laptops, and even computers thanks to the included splitter. While it could work with mobile phones, you’d run into the same issues with potentially damaging connector which would require soldering skills or having to replace the headset outright. The caveat here though is many mainstream phone manufacturers are killing the headphone jack and some people don’t expect to listen to audio on their cellphones without Bluetooth, so this is a more acceptable compromise to some than the choice made with the mic.<br /><br />- Conclusion<br />For $50 dollars Razer gives consumers a lot. This headset looks great, sounds good, devices crisp audio through the mic and even includes a code for a free and very useful 7.1 software sound emulation package. Razer made a fair share of compromises to get this headset down to the budget price range, but I think most will find their choices reasonable. If you’re in the market for a budget dedicated gaming headset you’d be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Razer Kraken X. Highly recommended!","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+z9ctAW4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+z9ctAW4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51+z9ctAW4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510DnNJ5wiL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510DnNJ5wiL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510DnNJ5wiL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GybhJGBL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GybhJGBL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/510GybhJGBL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51omazkIg4L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51omazkIg4L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51omazkIg4L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zicO+e7YL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zicO+e7YL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61zicO+e7YL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AHD3NGMLEO26ICLLAF72W7ELLUNA,2019-09-21 22:14:12.218,2,False

2338632,3,"Good sound, not that durable","Sorta disappointed. I got this headset in Dec 2020 and I went to put it on today and it cracks in the same spot as a bunch of other reviewers seem to picture.. the price was shown to be marked down, Christmas/Holiday clearanced from 60/70 but the price is the same as the discount then 🙄.. I wasn't expecting much from a headset that is priced under 50 but if you told me it was gonna break in a year and a few months I might've gone up a price range.. I had this set up for my Xbox for awhile and maybe one would get longer use out of it if you buy the with stand set but I'm sure you could find a cheaper stand that does the trick and put the over 100 price tag for that set with this product into a more durable headset that would last you 3-5 years.. I put this headset through the ringer when I was playing Xbox and yeah it's more worth it than the turtle beach sub 40 I had that sounded so pithy in the ears but clearly more of my money went into the brand on the side, long extension cord and the sound than the headset construction and frame.<br />TL;DR, I'd rate 3.8/5 stars if I could since they still sound semi nice not quite on par with my mobile~studio headset but nice enough but I would've liked them to last until the end of the year before needing replacement or duct tape to make sure the wires don't get more wear. Still gonna be using these because I can't afford a new headset now.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61m7QARph0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711gfDlfdyL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711gfDlfdyL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/711gfDlfdyL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSVWNRxTL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSVWNRxTL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71MSVWNRxTL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AFVMSJATEQF7XEVNNIAIHGXWDYVQ,2022-02-19 18:48:09.493,0,True

After owning it for less than a few months and very gently taking care of it, the left arm of the headset has broken from the band at the top.

2443124,5,Very good headphones for the money!,"If you're looking for a semi budget gaming headphones, please consider this ones as a good option. After several hours of using them I could tell many things to take in consideration regarding audio, construction materials and software. I'll explain them in the same order:<br /><br />- The audio sign let's say, is V shaped. They are good for gaming but not so balanced for listening music so your best bet is to use an equalizer to rise frequencies between 1.2k and 2.8k. The response for high frequencies could result a bit more than desired, in my case I lowered them from the 6.4k to 20k by 1dB o 2dB. Each ear is different so your best bet is to try them and balance them according to your needs. Bass frequencies (20-180Hz) are strong enough to tickle your ears.<br /><br />- The materials using for it's construction seems to be a bit fragile, so take care of them properly and don't stress the headphones too much when stretching them to fit them in your head. Other than that, time will tell.<br /><br />- Regarding the software... The surrond software included with them is just that, just an option to turn it on or off, the real deal is the THX Spatial that will be offered as upgrade later (which could count as a value increase for this item). THX Spatial could seem to be great at first use until you start comparing the original sound vs the one with spatial and start noticing the sounds are completely mixed up. For example, games like Quake Champions could result in a disaster of loud music, low player sounds and no positional sounding at all. In other games like Hellblade Senua's Sacrifice it's not bad at all but it could be a bit muffled or it simple sounds different (not good as it changes the original experience).<br /><br />For me, the big deal is to use Equalizer APO and HeSuVi (both free and open source) as equalizer and surround virtualization apps, even with a VST reverb in the EQ. Now the sound GREAT, you will have plenty of options to configure EQ profiles for your headphones and squeeze it's real potential using virtual 7.1. Both apps could take you a bit of time to learn how to using them but completely worth the time spent.<br /><br />And a plus, this headphones includes a split connector so they can easily be used with a PC (my current usage), with a console or even with your phone with its mic as a handsfree device (it has the mic+stereo audio type jack).","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61liP2rZWVL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61liP2rZWVL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61liP2rZWVL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713UsxzcW+L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713UsxzcW+L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/713UsxzcW+L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X2qwzm62L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X2qwzm62L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71X2qwzm62L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B09SK66MCS,B09C4DLF4P,AHLC5TLIYB3S2NYDLDE354UME4YA,2022-09-22 19:16:59.628,3,True

This was just from the simple act of putting them on and taking them off my head each day. No drops, no abuse, just average wear.

2547626,5,Why pay more unless you're really competing?,"I was looking for a good set of gaming headphones after I bought my gaming laptop.<br />I did my diligent research and read thru multiple reviews on multiple sites, for low end, mid, and high end. I also went thru at least 3 pages of reviews for each one I was interested in on Amazon.<br />There is clearly a fanboy base for certain brands where people will shell out however much just because of the name even if the product performs similarly to a lesser priced/different brand product.<br /><br />The Razer Kraken X has been nothing but excellent in all aspects. I am not a professional gamer nor do I participate in any real E-Sports type stuff. I DO participate in scrims - I play mostly FPS and racing games. The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. The ""earmuff"" parts don't get sweaty or sticky even if your adrenaline is up and you're the last one alive on your team. It comes with 7.1 Surround Sound which actually seems to help unlike the majority of bloatware extras that come with these kind of items. I have a fairly large head and the headphones extend enough. My ears fit perfectly inside to almost create a vacuum of outer noise cancellation. I can hear footsteps/etc in game from every direction way before I see the player. The mic is flexible and actually has one side you speak on, it picks up sound from a huge angle.<br /><br />Very very comfortable all around, really good sound for the price, mic picks up your voice and transmits it very clearly (asked my friends). Even after hours of playing, I don't feel like I need to take it off - it almost becomes unnoticeable after a while.

2730544,5,"Really good affordable option, if you take good care of it.","So, this headset lasted around 14 months before the adjustable band snapped on one side. But it wasn't fully detached yet, so I was able to slide it into the sheath and just use the adjustments on the opposite side. Two months or so later - aka right now - it fully snapped, and can't stay in the sheath anymore. The wire, though, is still intact, and I can still hear and talk just fine, and it can stay on my head, but of course I am going to be buying a new headset. Point is, be gentle with it, and it can last you a good while.<br /><br />So, sound quality is pretty good, and as far as I can tell the mic quality is too. I've never  used a high-quality headset in my life - so this was actually the best I've ever had personally. I'm sure there's better out there though, obviously you'll get what you pay for.

After a month I gave up to my infinitely more comfortable random brand bargain Chinese headset which I have had for over a year. All of the Razer's flaws then became very apparent.<br /><br />Firstly, the pros:<br /><br />-The bass control dial is always a big plus. It is very convenient to have to ability to change the bass intensity whenever you want.<br /><br />That's as far as the pros go and now for the cons:<br /><br />-ear cups are extremely small the majority of my outer ear and earlobes are smothered by the ear cups<br /><br />-The earcups are uncomfortable. The ear cups are not very soft. They seem to mold you to them rather than the other way around.<br /><br />-The noise cancellation is achieved by creating a complete seal around your ears. This of course does not feel alright and when trying to talk with both cups on I feel like a deaf person trying to talk.<br /><br />-The construction is cheap and flimsy. The frame is entirely made out of a rigid plastic that snaps if you bend it several degrees out of its form. Mine snapped just from me putting them on. My Chinese brand headset that is half the price uses some kind of light metal for the frame.<br /><br />Overall, if you buy these you're just buying it for the name.

3076256,5,Comfortable,"Very good product. It projects sound very well and is easy to use. i switched to a Razer about 3 months ago and it was a very good decision. I originally used a headset that was just a generic make. It surprisingly lasted me two years, but around the end I couldn't hear out of my left speaker and very staticky out of my right. One of my friends has used Razer for years and when I was in the market for headsets, he suggested it to me. I looked into and found a good deal. It was a much bigger jump from a generic make to a razer then I could have ever expected. The sound quality is so much better. As for gaming, I use it on everything. I mainly use it on laptop for playing fps games but have also used it on switch and PlayStation. The noise cancelling works very great. I have to physically take it off to hear stuff around me. The mic mute is very accessible. It is right next to the sound control, which has very good sound adjustments. Very comfortable and it never gets old wearing it.

Si quieres usarlo para escuchar música lo puedes hacer sin problema alguno, pero no te esperes algo del otro mundo. También es compatible con audio 7.1 (Si, si funciona, está ahí, personalmente no me importa mucho, pero si lo quieres ahí esta. Algo que debes tener en cuenta es que este 7.1 solo funciona con PC, no con otros dispositivos.)<br /><br />MIC 7/10<br />El micrófono no esta tan bien como el audio, en general es un buen micrófono pero en este headset (y en muchos otros) RAZER añadió varios filtros para ""ayudar"" al micrófono. Estos filtros muchas veces hacen que tu voz se escuche robotica o se escuche muy bajo. Por este precio hay peores, pero este no es el mejor micrófono.

En mi caso tengo orejas promedio y cabeza promedio. Pude durar hasta 4h+ usándolos y no me estaban irritando la oreja.

Not the audio just the ear cushion had disintegrated. So I bought Razer's new ""economy"" version of the Kraken and its really bad. The audio is sharp and tinny. Ear cushions and headband are uncomfortable. Cable is too short. And the Mic no longer retracts into the headset.

(I showed them screenshot of their own website showing the warranty.)<br />3) Could not honor warranty because it was only a one year warranty.

(I showed them pictures showing no animal bites or marks on the cord.)<br />5. They requested photos of the rest of the headphones to ensure they were actually Razer headphones. (I supplied these.)<br />6. Could not honor warranty because somebody had tampered with wires. (I showed them pictures again.)<br /><br />I spent a month in email with the support team.

Sadly, she felt they were too warm on her ears so didn't use them.<br /><br />I used my pair for about 2 months, then, the extender part on the left side broke.  I figured I was just being too rough with them even though I felt I wasn't.  So I shortened that side so the break was inside, and extended the other more.  I then took great care in putting them on/taking them off but 1 week later, the other side broke exactly like the right side.<br /><br />I contacted support who said it wasn't  under the warranty.  I read the warranty, and didn't see what part of the warranty said it wasn't covered.  So, I looked at the warranty, and the closest I could find was:<br /><br />""claims arising from any unacceptable use or care of the Product, including (without limitation) misuse, abuse, negligence, unauthorized modification or repair, unauthorized commercial use or any operation of the Product outside Razer's recommended parameters;""<br /><br />In their communication, they didn't say why it wasn't covered, so I asked what wasn't covered.  They pasted the warranty to me.  I replied asking what in that warranty suggested I wasn't covered.  I had to do this 2 more times before someone admitted they hadn't read my initial email.<br /><br />During this time, I started using my wife's headset.

The description said it was only minor box damage, so I figured that is okay because I'm just going to throw out the box anyways. I got the headphone in the mail and sure enough the box was damaged and had been open. Upon taking the headphones out I noticed that the ear cups were dirty, had some white powder stuff on it, gross. So I cleaned them off with some clorox wipes still wanting to keep them. Upon taking everything out of the box there was a card to download the software for the 7.1 surround sound software and had a product key that had been scratched off, so someone had used it. I downloaded the software and installed it. Sure enough it asked for the product key, so I entered the product key and the software said it was invalid. So it had already been used, great. Upon doing some research on google it looked like I was going to have to PURCHASE another key from razer. Forget that I'm not going to do that.

3630121,5,I am happy with a purchase,"Summary: The sound is wonderful, its everything what i was expecting from its price, i bought it for 39,99 (it had a small sale). It is made from plastic, but is quite durable and also comfortable to wear. I was not able to spend more on a headphone, and I am quite comfortable with the quality and experience of the bought one. Has a nice vacuum but its not yet a noice cancelation.  Anyways at this price that feature will not be found anyways. The only thing not quite comfy is microphone, being always attached. Overall ITS TOTALLY worth it, and the price Is great as well.<br />Built material and performance in more details. mostly its plastic, and thick one, so it stands great. Wire is rubbered in a way that if something gets damaged first I do not believe by any stretch of imagine that it will be the wire. Coshions are very soft and comfartable, and no dealbreaker for people with glasses, I am constantly wearing glasses and no downside was experienced with coshions. The same material is put on the upper part which holds your head on hair section, very comfortable anf soft feel, to be more accurate there is almost no feel of something on your head.<br />It creates a vacuum but I would not call it noice canceling headphone as you can compare with the real ones (which actually are 300 usd more or less, so I do not even care about their ""NOT EXCELENT NOICE CANCELATION"" as never expected getting one at this price range)<br />The deal of the mic is the following: its always there you need it or not, you can mute it with a phisical button, its easy and reachable, located on the left earcup, to which the mic is attached as well. The wire of mic seems good quality too, and is very flexible and stands strait in the position you stretch it, but stiil, can not dissapear, you can bend it away if you are not using it and for me it works fine. Next to mic mute button (which is also unmute button to bring the voice back) there is also a volume controller which I have not got used to it yet, well, not a dealbreaker as well, takes a second more to find them,<br />Quality really seems good, two months already, no phisical damage, neither any changes in performance, keeps me satisfied as I was.<br />In the bag it has two wires, one is for PC, the ones which has a mic and sound hole, usually green and pink ones (both 3.5mm), you can find them easily on your PC case where the input holes are located. The other one just gets connected with 3,5mm to already described one and has the headphones on the other end. I usually use the main one with the headphones with my laptop and phone ( basicly none of these does not have the pink hole for the mic as well, but actually it feels the same as with my PC when I use both wires) and the performance still is great.<br />Go get them if you are looking for a budget headphones with a nice performance for gaming or calls, can be considered as a great gift as well.",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AHT5L6PWIGHRL5DYI4ITC3QX5M7Q,2019-12-28 12:11:30.419,5,True

3831371,5,"If you’re looking for great value for your money, this is the product for you!","I was looking for a gaming headset that offered both an acceptable sound quality and an affordable price. What I received blew my expectations out of the park!<br /><br />First, the price: If price is your biggest concern, this is probably on the upper end of your budget. After all, there are much cheaper headsets on the market. From my experience, though, other options are just no good - crackly sound, not durable, lucky if the mic is even decent. The price listed for this headset was the upper end of what I was willing to pay - and I don’t regret it!<br /><br />For quality: If someone handed me this set of headphones and told me to price it based on the sound quality, I would’ve valued it at double the amount that I paid for. For the price I paid, the sound is excellent. There were three added bonuses: the durability, the size, and the mic quality. I am an extremely clumsy person - I break a lot of things. I’ve dropped this headset, smacked it against a wall, tugged the cords, the whole nine yards (all accidentally - I’m not abusing it on purpose), and it hasn’t broken on me yet- it’s pretty durable. I’m sure if I were trying to break it, it wouldn’t be difficult, but very few of you are looking at this and thinking, “I want to be able to bend this like a stick without it breaking”. For size - I wear small hats/helmets/headphones (think mid-range child sizes), and it’s hard to find stuff that actually fits me. The smallest size fits me perfectly. My boyfriend - who’s got a normal sized adult head (Lol) - can wear these comfortably as well. Lastly, the mic quality: This is something that wasn’t even a concern for me until people started complimenting me on how clear my voice sounds through the device.<br /><br />One thing that is interesting to me is that the mute button works perfectly fine on my PC but not on my laptop. I have no clue what’s going on there, but I highly doubt it’s an issue with the headphones.",[],B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AHHCJ4OKO4QQQ7XX6QADB5ZNL2UA,2020-09-08 17:07:35.326,0,True

The sides are made of incredibly cheap plastic after a few months of regular use I noticed what seemed to be the beginnings of a crack on the left side but it was small and I thought nothing of it until today when I went to put it on and I noticed a bigger crack which popped one of the wires out of its socket.

3900743,1,Not For Gaming,"To start, I am not one to normally leave a review. I try my best to research what I am buying to figure out if this is the best ""bang for your buck."" Let me start of by saying... NO, this is not. Out of the box I was excited, having worn out my last pair of headphones, I was looking for a relatively good price to quality headset, I've owned Razer gear in the past and have always been satisfied. These were great headphones... Until I plugged them in. For some context, I use my PC primarily for gaming, instead of using the standard microphone jack, I had to use the splitter as my desktop doesn't have a single 35 mm jack. I put the headset on and all was good until I heard some inconsistent static. I thought little of it for about 5 minutes, as it kept on persisting I was getting frustrated. Decided to ignore it and test out some audio and see how the microphone is. I use discord, a voice chat app for those of you who don't know. Started chatting with my friends, they immediately noticed something was wrong. I was quiet, too quiet. Thought it might be the apps voice settings, still having issues, then I checked my PC's audio recording settings. Still too quiet, I had thought I fixed the issue after tweaking the settings for about 20 minutes... I was told I sounded better. Oh good, it might be fixed...No. I load up a youtube video, and if you're a young adult like me you aren't a stranger to ignorantly loud music. Before the song even started... My friends through discord could hear the youtube advertisement playing. No matter what I did, this headset has no noise cancellation features whatsoever. You can play with settings all you want, you will either be too quiet, or your friends will hear the neighbor closing their door down the block. To cut this short (because I could go on for 9 pages on why you shouldn't buy this) dont... The only redeeming quality is the decent audio, the music sounded great, if I wanted everyone on the other end of the line to hear it. If that's all you want it for, 10/10 buy it, if you want a functional gaming headset, go to walmart and spend 20$ its more worth your money.<br />P.S the static never went away",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AFJXQVKI4IYYTEKA4D5LC2UISQJA,2020-08-24 22:26:13.854,3,True
3902432,2,Garbage and Overpriced.  These broke after only 6 months through regular non-abusive use.,"I used this headset maybe 1- 4 times a week. I use it for regular gaming use, connecting it to my PC for discord use or straight into my PS4 controller.  I've only had them for about 6 months and the top piece where the set connects to the each speaker broke apart. On the surface you see a think piece of plastic and foam piece entombed in pleather for it to rest on your head.  Now that it's broken I can see inside and its empty, that thin piece of plastic is all you get, and there is nothing inside of it for any for of support.  If I wanted a cheaply constructed headset with 7.1 surround there are certainly plenty of much cheaper options on amazon.  SADES makes better headsets that this.  I had a Plantronics headset for 5 years and it never broke down like this.  I dont abuse my headsets, this should not have broken apart like this.

4228169,1,Razer Customer Service is VERY difficult to deal with!!,"So, while this headset is of decent quality (initially) and fairly priced, overall, I would not recommend that you buy it. I am in the process of my second return for the second defective one. I originally purchased it back in June, but the cord began to fray. After a week of emailing back and forth, sending pics, answering the same questions over and over, etc. they finally accepted the return and provided a RMA. The entire process took from 7/28 until 9/13 before I had a replacement headset.  This time, the headphones have become staticky and the audio clips and cuts out.  I began the current return process on 2/1, so I am on day three of providing requested information. For some reason, they don't ask for everything up front or provide a form to fill out. They will ask you a handful of questions on the first response, a day or two will go by, and then they will ask you another handful of questions. A day or two will go by, and then they'll ask for more info. I'm of the opinion that most of the information could be obtained by looking up the order number. Then, they will finally ask for proof of purchase, and it will have to be in a very particular format. I gave them screenshots in a PDF of the Amazon order information, but then they wanted a PDF from the receipt you would print. Either way, they both had the EXACT same information. Now, my latest reply is that the PDF is ""corrupt"", so I had to resend it. It opens fine on my PC and iPad, but whatever.

All was good for a while until today something bad happened:the right speaker broke off. I went to put it on and for some odd reason it felt odd to wear then when I took it off that's when I saw it snapped off. I am sorry to say this but the material on this headset is nothing but cheap plastic. This thing barley lasted a year and now I am without a headset. Thank god I only paid 25 dollars for this product because for retail its plain ridiculous.

The ear-pieces put a lot of pressure at the base of the ears/neck which get uncomfortable after 20 minutes.<br /><br />- Terrible Mic. I've never had a mic this bad on a headset.

My head is narrower in the back and the ear pads don't sit flush against my head. Makes it every uncomfortable since it applies all its force to the front of my ears. The sound quality changes too (I thought it was just poor sound quality). When I push down on my headphones to where it's completely sealed around my ears, the sound improves dramatically!

4228500,2,"Great headset, but...","After owning this headset for a total of a few hours over a week, I find myself upset. I can hear you asking, ""Why?"" and first what I'll tell you is to be patient and let me explain, but then I'll tell you exactly what's up with this headset.<br />My first impressions of the product was that it was very comfortable and had decent sound. The microphone was a little soft but I managed to fix that with a little workaround I found myself since the Razer Synapse app doesn't work for this particular model. I found myself enjoying listening to music, watching videos, and watching movies with this headset for the week I had it. It was great!<br />So then, why do I give it 2 stars? Well, yesterday (as of writing this review) I found out that a few days prior my headset had broken a little bit. It wasn't too much of an issue, it just caused the earphone part to not fit perfectly over my ears as they had when I had first gotten the headset, and I could just readjust the headband sliders. No big deal, although I was a little upset as this hadn't been used too heavily.<br />Cut to today: I'm watching a movie and thoroughly enjoying it when all of a sudden, I feel the earphone break completely. I take off the headset, and as pictured in the pictures attached, the earphone was dangling by a wire. Obviously I am very upset and I'm looking into what can be done about this, but since I didn't have the money for the Amazon warranty, I'm afraid I wasted nearly $40 on a headset I probably should not have purchased in the first place. I'm in contact with Razer support and hopefully they can do something to help me out but as of now I simply can't use this headset at all anymore and, as previously stated, I've had this for a few hours over a week.<br />It should be noted that by ""light use"", I mean I didn't do anything that should have or could have broken any normal headset. I wore it to sleep 4 times and that was the most heavy the use got. Most headsets I've used survived the same kind of use for well over a year, so I assumed this one could too.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMkaWQczL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMkaWQczL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YMkaWQczL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}, {'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xZH5tNeUL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xZH5tNeUL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81xZH5tNeUL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AHIG43G35JE66R36XVWVXJ5SD7SQ,2021-08-29 12:57:41.954,0,True
4228502,5,MICROPHONE IS SUPRISINGLY GREAT!,"Ive been using these headphones for 2 months before writeing this review.<br /><br />The Razer Kraken X wired gaming headset is perfect for its price. The sound quality when using the virtual 7.1 surround sound is good for some games that utilize at least 5.1 surround sound. (Make sure you are using the correct audio channels.) The sound quality is great for gaming.<br /><br />The noise cancellation is definitely there. There is even notches in the ear cups for people that wear glasses. They are not visible, but you can feel around with your finger.<br /><br />Since these are using a 3.5 mm jack, they will work with PC, Android, Xbox one s controllers, and PS4 with sound and Microphone. It will even work for sound on the nintendo switch. A longer cord is included for PC that goes into two separate 3.5 mm ports (one for sound and one for mic) Honestly usb isn't any better from my experiences with other headsets. The volume can be adjusted with a wheel on the headset.<br /><br />What blew me away was the microphone. Ive done some recordings and the quality was phenomenal for a budget gaming headset. It truely is a cardiod microphone that wont pick up background noises like key clicks anddistant voices. Ive even used it for online college classes and got complented for how clean I sounded on a zoom meeting. It can be muted with a button if needed.<br /><br />I also find the headset to be quite comfortable. It can be worn for long periods of time. They did not bother me at all. They are adjustable to move up and down but the ear cups do not swivel which gives the headset some extra durability. (A+) Eventhough its mostly plastic, they do not feel cheap at all.<br /><br />Overall, these are a must buy if you are looking for a wired gaming headset!

4228528,4,Excellent multi-use headset for the price. A few minor flaws.,"I bought this headset primarily for video conferencing with my teams now that I primarily work from home. I alternated between either my AirPods or Bose QC35's for a while and while they worked well for short calls, the batteries would die quickly or they would begin to hurt my ears. The Razer headsets were highly recommended by a coworker who does a lot of gaming so I gave them a shot.<br /><br />The Good:<br />For the price, these are an amazing wired headset. They are extremely light as advertised and after a while of wearing them, you don't notice them on your head. They feel very well constructed and don't feel like cheap plastic headphones. The ear cups are quite large and deep and do not press on your ear. They have lots of padding to make them comfortable for long periods of time. The microphone is extremely clear. People on calls have been impressed with how clear my voice sounds with almost no background noise being heard. It comes with a decent length 3.5mm Stereo/Mic jack and a longer extension cable to split the audio out and microphone in, which is a nice addition for some users.<br /><br />The Not-So-Good:<br />- The headphone's audio is good, but it's not great out of the box. Razer advertises this headset as a 7.1 Surround Sound headset but their 7.1 Surround Sound software is only available on Windows, which was a bit of a let down as a Mac user. I ended up installing Boom3D on my Mac which I assume is doing a similar thing as their software, and it sounds better.<br /><br />- There is not a ton of padding at the top of the headphones which can hurt the top of your head after long periods of time. (though this seems to be the case with most over-ear headsets).<br /><br />- Razer advertises this headset with ""Eyewear Channels"" for comfort while wearing glasses, but I have found that after long periods of time with glasses the sides of your head can hurt a bit.<br /><br />I highly recommend this headset for people wanting a solid multi-use headset without dealing with the hassle of batteries, Bluetooth, and high costs.",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AF35WW6UVKP3VKPS2LKWLZXXASIA,2020-03-31 23:17:18.057,9,True

Still usable but barely..<br /><br />Literally 2-3 months into owning and on both left and right sides, where the headset adjusts at, formed VERY noticeable cracks. Sadly the right side got to the point to where I had to create a homemade splint and tape around it to prevent the whole right earcup from falling off.<br /><br />I still use it, since it still works fine but durability wise it's a HUGE bummer for this to happen soooo soon. The issue ( just like with logitechs g430's I've owned before that suffered the same) is that the hinges and/or the piece connecting to the hinges are plastic.... And naturally while opening using the headset daily, will gradually start to ""stress"" around certain points.<br /><br />All in all the headset is amazing for the price, but if you don't have an actually miniscule size head or take 20000% care of your headset when putting them on and off, they'll form cracks over time.

However, I didn't use it for almost a year b/c I didn't need it. I kept it in pretty good condition while I did other things.

This was my main concern, but I didn't even notice the larger cracks that were developing on the main part of the headband. They eventually gave way this month, and the headphones now loosely fit my head. One lesson I've learned is that you should avoid getting these headphones. The build quality is very lousy, as Razer has only bothered to use a plastic frame for the headphones. There aren't any metal reinforcements or anything to prevent the headphones from losing their shape.

4228738,1,NOT Worth It,"This product did not last long at all. I purchased them in March so it has only been about 2 months. The sound quality isn’t the best but its whatever considering that they are on the more affordable side. The headset dropped from desk height so about 3 feet off the ground and it snapped off right away. I contacted the company since there is still warrant on the product. They declined to replace the item since it is a physical damage. If this was purchased a year ago and it snapped off recently I wouldn’t have mind. But it’s still fairly new, it has only been 2 months! I also saw in the reviews that someone recently bought this and their headset snapped off at the same area. This definitely needs to be sturdier. Considering that it is $50, I’m not expecting the best quality but this product is cheaply made for 50 bucks. There are better ones out there in the $30 range.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A13aepzQN0L._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A13aepzQN0L._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A13aepzQN0L._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMSM477,B09C4DLF4P,AFTLRIP4PGHGBMRVA5ZQ37AX5UOQ,2021-05-19 17:29:07.927,0,True

I compare these to my sony ch700n headphones; while my sony headphones have a little better fidelity, these Razer headphones close the gap considerably. I mean, the difference is slight and of course these are superior with their external mic for gaming vs the internal mic for the ch700s.<br />Now, the one complaint I have is the headphone coverage feels a bit small on my ear, I have to adjust them a bit before I find that perfect snug fit over my ears. On the positive, the noise cancelling works better than others in the budget category and I find the spatial sound software gives me a surround sound experience on par with far more expensive brands. Another good note is I find I can really crank these headphones loud, something I find an issue with other brands sometimes (although this could just be issues with my other<br />hardware)<br />In short, these headphones will not disappoint you for their budget category. They may be under 60$, but function like a 100$ pair. If you get these, do yourself a favor and invest in the spatial sound software you can get through Razer's website as this will really help these headphones shine.",[],B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AHCY334QEYJJSFFDNKS6ADCG532A,2020-12-25 14:25:53.104,0,True

The cord also tends to get twisted, and the surround sound program is obnoxious to set up, but those are lesser issues compared to the durability problem.<br /><br />If you have a smaller head, then I suspect this would be a good purchase.

I was worried, my last pair gave me a horrible impression of headset quality in the price range, but these Razer Kraken are significantly better. They are incredibly comfortable and forget that I have them in after some time. The noise cancellation is just as amazing, which is great cause I have loud roommates. With these on, and the living room party being right outside my door, I surprisingly don’t even hear what’s going on.

The microphone quality was clear enough and picked up sound accurately. The sound quality was also good for the price, obviously not great but they were crisp and very versatile.<br /><br />Over time though, the top of the headphones began to show signs of stress, and a little more than a year later, they finally cracked at the headband part. I have not mistreated them in any way, but constantly stretching them to put them over my head caused this crack. The thin plastic shell is the only thing keeping tension, and without it, they sit limply on my head like a belt would if you draped it over your head.<br /><br />I would recommend these for those with smaller or average-sized heads since simply stretching them slightly to put them over my head caused them to break.","[{'small_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31hNhMh+UeL._SL256_.jpg', 'medium_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31hNhMh+UeL._SL800_.jpg', 'large_image_url': 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31hNhMh+UeL._SL1600_.jpg', 'attachment_type': 'IMAGE'}]",B07RMC5BRL,B09C4DLF4P,AFQ3P6ZSLL332A5UXC4TIOQXJC4A,2023-05-30 19:12:51.044,9,True
